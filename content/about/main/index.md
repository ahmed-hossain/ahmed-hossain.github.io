  Thanks for stopping by!

  I work as a research assistant at Dr Theocharis Baxevanis's lab. My research interests lies in understanding how different materials behave at a fundamental level and applying that knowledge to develop a newer generation of materials suitable for ever-evolving material application.

  Currently, I am working on the bistable auxatic materials which includes investigating their constituent properties and dynamica and vibrational responses.

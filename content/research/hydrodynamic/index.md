abstract: >-
  Funded by the Research and Innovation Center for Science and Technology (RISE) at BUET, the research focused on comparing the output power of a hydrokinetic turbine using two different airfoil sections through computer simulations and practical experiments. The study involved the application of the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) algorithm for blade design, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and experimental testing with a physical model. **My contributions included designing the experimental setup in 3D CAD for turbine testing, manufacturing the experimental arrangement using both traditional methods and 3D printing, and conducting the necessary experiments to validate the results.**

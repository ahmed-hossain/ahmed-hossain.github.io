  The intermetallic compound Cobalt-Titanium is well known for its low density,
  high strength, and high corrosion resistance in a vast temperature interval.
  Thus, Co-Ti alloys have found use in aircraft, building, and medicinal
  industries. The addition of Cobalt to Titanium decreases the melting
  temperature while increasing the strength, mitigating a lot of casting
  problems.  Computational methods for simulating fracture and crack propagation
  have been a significant research focus for decades. Molecular dynamics
  simulation can potentially observe and predict crack initiation and
  propagation. Moreover, atomistic simulations-based prediction can be employed
  to model the traction-separation law accurately, which is the basis for
  cohesive zone modeling techniques. The present study investigates crack
  propagation of B2 phase Cobalt-Titanium alloy across a range of temperatures
  (300K, 600K, 900K) under mode-I loading based on constrained three-dimensional
  atomistic simulations. Stress developments and lattice structure evolution
  during crack propagation were observed, and a traction-separation law for
  cohesive zone modeling was developed from these simulations to integrate
  atomistic insights into macroscopic fracture models. The computations under
  the mode I condition show that crack growth, even in the nano-scale
  single-crystal Co-Ti, is in the form of void nucleation, void growth, and
  coalescence, similar to ductile fracture at the mesoscale. This information
  can contribute to the understanding and characterizing of Co-Ti’s mechanical
  response under the mode-I loading conditions and how fracture will propagate
  on a molecular level. The cohesive traction-separation law modeled in this
  study based on the traction-separation curve can be used in the macro-scale
  FEM study to simulate arbitrary crack propagation in the bulk material.

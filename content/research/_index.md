      subtitle: ''
      text: |
        During my undergraduate studies, I took a range of theoretical and sessional courses that provided me with a solid theoretical foundation in core mechanical  topics, as well as some practical laboratory experience. In addition, I worked on various research projects, acquiring valuable skills in computational simulation, experimental testing, and programming.

        Currently, I am looking forward to pursuing my doctoral studies in the field of mechanical and material engineering. My research interests include but not limited to **Computational Mechanics**, **Material Behavior**, **Advanced Materials**, **Additive Manufacturing** and **Machine Learning**.

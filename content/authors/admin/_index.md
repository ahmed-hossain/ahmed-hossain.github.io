# About Me
I am at my first year of PhD in mechanical engineering. As a research assistant at Dr. Theocharis Baxevanis's lab, I am currently working on **Bistable Auxetic Materials** a.k.a. self-deploying materials where I will be investigating their constituent properties, and dynamic and vibrational responses under different kind of loads.

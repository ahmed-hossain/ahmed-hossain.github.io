Everybody needs their personal websites. If you are a graduate student doing some important research, you need to more. You need to present your work to the world and what can be a better place than your website?

## Why Did I build my website?
I want to build my online presence and showcase what's I am working on.

## Why not Google site or wix or other drag-N-drop website builders?
They offer a very easy to make experience while building website but their customization options are quite limited and comes with a lot of restriction.

## Prerequisites
You need a little bit of programming knowledge and a lot of time.

```latex
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

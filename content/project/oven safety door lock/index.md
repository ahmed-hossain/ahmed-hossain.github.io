## Abstract
The task involved designing a safety lock for oven and stove doors to prevent accidental burns by restricting access to children. The resulting lock is a durable, easy-to-install device that effectively withstands high temperatures and secures the door in a locked position, preventing accidental opening. Its mechanism is designed to be childproof, yet simple for adults to unlock,offering enhanced safety without compromising convenience. Constructed from high-temperature-resistant plastic, the lock is attached to the oven or stove door and frame using strong adhesive tape, eliminating the need for drilling or wiring. This versatile design is compatible with a variety of oven and stove door types, providing a secure and adaptable solution to child safety concerns in the kitchen.

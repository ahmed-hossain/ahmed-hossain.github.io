- Improvised and developed multiple functional and synchronous mechanisms to mechanically and sequentially shoot, reload and reset a Gaussian cannon.

- Built a head-mounted tracking system consisting of an accelerometer, Arduino microcontroller and wireless RF modules to control a 2-DOF arm that imitates the userâ€™s head movement.

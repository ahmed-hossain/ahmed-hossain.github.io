  The project aimed to develop a prototype for a digital locking system that
  integrates a manual cylinder lock mechanism with fingerprint recognition,
  enabling the door to be unlocked either via an authorized fingerprint or a
  key, with each method functioning independently. I designed an innovative
  mechanism incorporating sector gears, a cam, a spring, and a rack-and-pinion
  assembly to achieve seamless operation of the lock. The prototype was
  fabricated using 3D printing, and subsequent testing verified its
  functionality, demonstrating precise and reliable performance in both
  unlocking modes.

abstract: >-
  The task involved designing a safety lock for oven and stove doors to prevent
  accidental burns by restricting access to children. The resulting lock is a
  durable, easy-to-install device that effectively withstands high temperatures
  and secures the door in a locked position, preventing accidental opening. Its
  mechanism is designed to be childproof, yet simple for adults to unlock,
  offering enhanced safety without compromising convenience. Constructed from
  high-temperature-resistant plastic, the lock is attached to the oven or stove
  door and frame using strong adhesive tape, eliminating the need for drilling
  or wiring. This versatile design is compatible with a variety of oven and
  stove door types, providing a secure and adaptable solution to child safety
  concerns in the kitchen.

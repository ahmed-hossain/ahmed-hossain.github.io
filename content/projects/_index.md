        Throughout my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunities to work on several mechanical and electromechanical projects where I had to use hands on designing and manufacturing techniques in addition to the theoratical concepts to bring an idea into realization. While working on these projects, I gained valuable skills in **Mechanical design**, **3d cad modeling**, **FEM simulations**, **3d printing**, **Arduino** and many other tools and techniques. Recently, I started learning machine learning and trying out different types of projects to bolster the concepts.

  A Gaussian cannon is a device that uses magnetic fields to propel and shoot a
  ferromagnetic projectile. Several identical units, each consisting of a fixed
  permanent magnet and a pair of ferromagnetic balls, are sequentially arranged
  in an array to constitute the device. When a ferromagnetic ball impacts the
  magnet at the start of the array with a relatively low speed, the ball at the
  other end of the array gets ejected with a much larger speed.


  Conventionally, each time the device is triggered, the ferromagnetic balls
  need to be re-positioned manually before the device can be triggered again. In
  this paper, an axial cam mechanism has been employed to mechanize the
  triggering and re-positioning of the ferromagnetic balls within the device.
  Additionally, a rotary mechanism has been implemented to replace an ejected
  projectile with a new one. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between the
  projectile velocity and the cam profile and optimized the cam profile for the
  maximum projectile velocity.

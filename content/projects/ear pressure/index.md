abstract: >-
  Design and fabrication of a device to predict potential health issues by monitoring pressure variations in the tympanic membrane. A functional prototype is being developed, with plans in place for a medical trial to validate its effectiveness. Upon successful testing, the device could potentially be mass-produced to make this health-monitoring innovation widely accessible.
